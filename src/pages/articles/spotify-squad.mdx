## Spotify Main Phylosophy

Spotify main philosophy:

- We create innovative products while managing risk by prototyping early and cheaply.
- We don’t launch on date, we launch on quality.
- We ensure that our products go from being great at launch to becoming amazing, by relentlessly tweaking after launch.

All major product initiatives go through four stages:			

- **Think It** = figure out what type of product we are building and why.
- **Build It** = create a minimum viable product that is ready for real users.
- **Ship It** = gradually roll out to 100% of all users, while measuring and improving.
- **Tweak It** = Continuously improve the product. This is really an end state; the product stays in Tweak It until it is shut down or reimagined (= back to Think It).

## Processes Definitions

### **Squads:**
Similar to a scrum team, Squads are cross-functional, autonomous teams (typically 6-12 individuals) that focus on one feature area. Each Squad has a unique mission that guides the work they do, an agile coach for support, and a product owner for guidance. Squads determine which agile methodology/framework will be used.

### **Tribes:**
When multiple Squads coordinate within each other on the same feature area, they form a Tribe. Tribes help build alignment across Squads and typically consist of 40 - 150 people in order to maintain alignment. Each Tribe has a Tribe Lead who is responsible for helping coordinate across Squads and for encouraging collaboration.

### **Chapter:**
Even though Squads are autonomous, it’s important that specialists (e.g. Javascript Developer, DBAs) align on best practices. Chapters are the family that each specialist has, helping to keep engineering standards in place across a discipline. Chapters are typically led by a senior technology lead, who may also be the manager for the team members in that Chapter.

### **Guild:**
Team members who are passionate about a topic can form a Guild, which essentially is a community of interest. Anyone can join a Guild and they are completely voluntary. Whereas Chapters belong to a Tribe, Guilds can cross different Tribes. There is no formal leader of a Guild. Rather, someone raises their hand to be the Guild Coordinator and help bring people together.

### **Trio:**
The Trio (aka TPD Trio) is a combination of a Tribe Lead, product lead, and design lead. Each Tribe has a Trio in place to ensure there is continuous alignment between these three perspectives when working on features areas

### **Alliance:**
As organizations scale, sometimes multiple Tribes need to closely work together to accomplish a goal. Alliances are a combination of Tribe Trios (typically three or more) that work together to help their Tribes collaborate on a goal that is bigger than any one Tribe.
